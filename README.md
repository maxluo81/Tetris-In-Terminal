# Tetris In Terminal
A project I made senior year of high school.

### How to play
1. Copy main.cpp, tetris.cpp and tetris.hpp into any IDE or code editor.
2. Hit run.
3. Controls:
   * Left and right arrow to move sideways
   * Up arrow to rotate clockwise
   * Down arrow to soft drop
   * C to hard drop
   * D to store piece
5. Have fun!
